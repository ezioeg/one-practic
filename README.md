## üõ†Ô∏è One Practic  
Practice project developed with React Native CLI, focused on implementing a basic app structure with navigation, reusable components, and CRUD operations for products. The app connects to a custom Nest.js API, which is available in the same GitHub repository under the name `graphrestapi-nest`.

### Features  
- Basic navigation using React Navigation, with reusable components and app structure.  
- Product listing fetching data from the custom REST API.  
- Product detail view displaying relevant product information.  
- Create, update, and delete (CRUD) operations for products implemented via REST.  
- GraphQL CRUD operations are planned but not yet implemented.
